Qt SDK Repo Chooser
===================
If you are using the online [Qt 5 SDK](http://www.qt-project.org/downloads) but
downloads are slow and/or you frequently get disconnected, this tool might help.
You might have been assigned a mirror that is performing poorly. The Qt SDK Repo
Chooser helps you select a non-default mirror, which might give you a better
download experience.

Ideally, the causes of this issue should be solved upstream. Please add your
thoughts, ideas, and votes to the reports at [QTIFW-5](https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTIFW-5)
and [QTIFW-441](https://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTIFW-441). In the
meantime though, I hope this tool is useful for you to get started with Qt.
